          The state of WI health department has made a rule stating that if you have vermiculite insulation in your home or apartment building 4 units or smaller that it can not be disturbed by some one unless they are certified to remove asbestos.
        </p>
        <p class="text-dgrey">
          <strong>What does this mean to you?</strong><br />

          If you have vermiculite insulation in your home you are not able to have a contractor in your attic to repair or replace any thing that would disturbe this material. Also by law insulation companies are not allowed to add insulation over the top of vermiculite if they are going to "disturbe the matrix of the material." That is in the DHS code.
        </p>

          <strong>How we differ from others</strong><br />

          Our company has designed a peice of equipment that allows us to use a very large 120 hp diesel hepa vacuum to remove any insulation in an attic that will fit through a hose. This "dust box" was designed and built by us and to the best of our knolwedge the only one in use. This allows us to remove all insulation that will fit through the hose with the vacuum. It also allows us to preform this with out the need for bags outside the house elemenating the risk of a bag break and poential contamination.<br /><br />

          Our process is safe, fast, and efficant. Leaving a nice clean space for the insulators or remodelers coming in behind us.
